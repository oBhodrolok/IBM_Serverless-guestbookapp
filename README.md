# serverless-guestbook
Leverage the serverless and microservices knowledge acquired throughout this course. 

Interact with IBM Cloud to provision two types of services: a Cloudant database and Cloud Object Storage. 

Create actions and sequences to store entries in and retrieve entries from the Cloudant Database. 


Expose above sequences using web actions and an API. 

Host the front end for the guestbook web application as a microservice on OpenShift and as static files on Cloud Object Storage.
